Just finished learning HTML basics. Now I will be starting with this beginner level project to make a website contaning recepies. 

It will include my application capabilities of what I have learned so far which includes- basic HTML tags(headings, paragraphs,images, links, text(bold,italics)).

Apart from HTML I will also be applying my knowledge of git and github which includes setting up a repository, cloning a repository to my machine, making changes to the files and commiting those changes.
