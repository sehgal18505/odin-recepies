            Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems.<br> 
            You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
            <h3>
                Ingredients:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</l1>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Vanilla</li>
                <li>Baking Soda</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Spices and Seasoning</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Steps:
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
                <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
                <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
                <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes.<br> 
            The edges should be golden brown and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the cool).
